Welcome to my first presentation at Toastmasters, titled "The Ice Breaker." And what better way to break the ice than to explore a fascinating question about the power of play and its true impact. I've been reflecting on this a lot recently, and I'll be sharing how it connects to my life and, ultimately, to why I'm here at Toastmasters.

As a child, my favorite games were the unstructured ones - those where children created the rules - no adults, just pure imagination. These were often games like hide-and-seek but we changed the rules to make them more fun. For example we would pretend to have guns and "shoot" at each other and the most important rule was that if you were "shot," you had to admit it and wait for the next round.

I was just a preschooler, and the walking to meet these friends was long and, at times, a little scary. But the excitement was always worth it. I admired being included in the company of older children. I remember feeling the thrill of dividing into teams, but I also recall being skeptical of whether other kids were truly following the often complex and challenging rules. Nevertheless, we, the children, invented and largely followed these rules, all for the sake of keeping the game alive.

It wasn't until many years later that I fully grasped the profound importance of unstructured play. Such games foster discipline, connection, enthusiasm, independent thinking, social skills, and negotiation skills—all essential qualities of effective leadership.

In contrast, formal schooling is all about structure and conformity over creativity and independent thought. This difference became very clear to me when I realized that, for me, school was often about punishing children for their enthusiasm and independent thinking; as if they were trying to control how we think.

Despite this harsh environment, I was able to carry that "flickering fire of unstructured play, enthusiasm and joy" into adulthood. For example, in my Kizomba dancing – where I am a leader – playfulness and musicality are essential. I cultivate these elements by developing my own original concepts, moves, and variations and then I put them to practice where I train and challenge myself just the right amount to maximize enjoyment. It’s this "playing" with the music and steps on the dance floor that my dance partners deeply appreciate.

Do you know kizomba dance? Its basically walking. And leading in kizomba means leading only at specific moments—such as when changing direction or speed. Most of the time, the follower moves independently while I follow her movement. So being a leader necessarily also means being a follower. And this concept of leading applies equally so outside the dance floor, for example in professional relationships.

And that brings me to my day job, which might seem completely unrelated.

In my professional role, I build electronic devices. I often receive them in [a non-functional state], and my job is to breathe life into these devices—essentially giving them a "soul" and a heartbeat—so they can fulfill their purpose of helping people.

This specific device allows individuals to safely and seamlessly enter residential and commercial buildings using an NFC tag or mobile phone via Bluetooth.

This work is not just about problem solving and finding good solutions. But it also involves communicating with individuals from different departments, which can be challenging but is essential for ensuring that everyone is aligned and working toward the same goals.

So, from childhood games to dancing to breathing life into electronics, what's the common thread? For me, it's the pursuit of leadership skills, which is precisely why I joined Toastmasters. I've come to realize that reasoning from first principles allows you to see through complexity and understand the core truths of a situation. Once you start thinking for yourself, you can no longer blindly follow the crowd. So it's leadership, or isolation. That's why developing these skills is so important to me.
