# My First Blog Post

Welcome to my blog! I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts and experiences with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator that's perfect for blogging.

## Why I Chose Jekyll
- **Simple**: Easy to set up with Markdown files.
- **Fast**: Static sites load quickly and are secure.
- **Customizable**: Themes and plugins make it flexible.

In this post, I'll share what I learned about creating posts in Jekyll:

1. **Posts go in `_posts`**: Files need a `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md` format.
2. **Front matter is key**: It defines metadata like title, date, and tags.
3. **Preview locally**: Use `bundle exec jekyll serve` to test.

Stay tuned for more posts about Jekyll, Rust, and other tech topics I'm exploring!
