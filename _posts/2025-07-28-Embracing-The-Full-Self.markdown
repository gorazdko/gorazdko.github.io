Our personality is a mix of inner voices, they are our internal family, they harmonize or clash with each other. Imagine an inner table where every part of us is welcome. But what happens when a harsh critic or a self-sabotaging part tries to take over? Can these difficult parts join our dinner table without disrupting the meal?

Have you ever struggled with an inner voice, like a critical parent, you can’t seem to silence?

Where do these difficult parts come from? Well, when parents get triggered and punish, children learn to restrain themselves to avoid trouble—this builds internal controlling parts, like an inner parent.

Looking back as an adult, I realized how this internalization process shaped me. I was growing up with parents who were often abusive—sometimes through yelling, harsh criticism or other hurtful behaviour. And over time i found my own inner parent learning these patterns, making me feel stressed or attacked. But in truth, it was attempting to shield me from the external punishment.

It became evident to me that our inner critics are not the enemies. They are our protectors.

Think about how strictly you follow traffic rules when a police car is behind you. Suddenly, you don’t risk running yellow lights. That sense of anxiety? It’s your internal cop, designed to protect you from the real cop so you don’t get arrested.

But just as constantly trying to appease an external cop can become exhausting, continuously trying to appease parental aggression internally doesn’t work in the long run. Parents always find something else that triggers them, leading us to build up more and more self-control—until we become paralyzed. You might reach a point where you feel unable to speak, think, be playful, feel confident, or express happiness —even if no one is watching.

At this point, these protective parts are still trying to keep us safe, though their ways may no longer help us. However, when we're no longer around the people who originally triggered these responses, that inner voice often tends to quiet down. In fact, by distancing myself from my real parents I got my inner voice to relax, allowing it to truly become my own, and free from the control of my real parents.

So, I’m very very grateful for my inner parents, whose voices keep me safe even today. At work, when I sense manipulation, I get a gut feeling which is their protection, urging me to speak up and even step away if needed.

Ultimately, by befriending our shadow parts, we invite them to our inner table, creating harmony within. This journey of self understanding isn’t easy, but it’s rewarding. Accepting all of ourselves lets us live authentically and inspires others to do the same.
