Ethics often boils down to power. A corrupt security guard is bad, but a corrupt cop? Worse. A corrupt judge? Very dangerous. Why? Because the more power you hold, the greater the harm you can cause.

But where’s the biggest power disparity in the world? Not between a king and a peasant. It’s in the home—between parents and their children. Children do not choose to be born into the family, nor their parents, and almost always they cannot choose to leave. This fundamental imbalance carries enormous responsibility for parents.

Unfortunately, the most dangerous parents are those who are convinced they are always right and blame their children entirely for misbehavior. But if a child struggles, it’s up to the teacher or parent to reflect on how to improve, not to blame the child.

For example, when a child throws a tantrum over candy in a store, instead of saying, “No, you’re not getting any,” parents can acknowledge the child’s desire, saying, “I could eat this whole row myself.” This shows empathy while modeling restraint. Kids don’t really just want things as much as they want to be heard, understood, and recognized.

This is the essence of peaceful parenting—rooted in reciprocity, negotiation, and helping children understand others' perspectives. To raise children this way, parents must model it consistently.

Yet despite this ideal, children remain society’s most vulnerable members and often suffer greatest injustice. While we teach them basic lessons like “Don’t hit, don’t steal,” many societies still encourage hitting children.

Even more common now is verbal abuse—yelling, shaming, and harsh words—that quietly harm a child’s sense of self worth. Furthermore, society keeps stealing from children in the form of national debt. Every child in the west is now born with a million dollars in debt. It is important to undersatnd that, Society is just an effect of parenting. If we truly cared about children as we claim, we wouldn’t be running up credit card debts in their names without their consent.

Anyway, this systemic failure then pushes many young adults into drug addiction, promiscuity, isolation, and alcohol use—all forms of self-medication for people suffering from child abuse. These people don’t turn to addiction to feel good; but to feel normal because normal feels impossible.

Ultimately, If we raised children peacefully, many social dysfunctions would mostly disappear. Science is clear: peaceful upbringing results in significantly less criminality, promiscuity, and mental disorders. Teaching children peacefully also diminishes their drive to control others, helping us slowly move away from a society held together by force and fear. Remember, it all starts in the home.
